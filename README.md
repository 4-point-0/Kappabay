# Eliza-KappaBay System

This is a combination system consisting of two separate projects that work together:

1. **eliza-kappabay-agent** - ElizaOS AI Agent component
   - Contains the AI agent functionality
   - See its [README.md](eliza-kappabay-agent/README.md) for setup and running instructions

2. **kappabay-terminal-next** - Terminal interface component
   - Provides the user interface layer
   - See its [README.md](kappabay-terminal-next/README.md) for setup and running instructions

## System Setup

To run the complete system:

1. First set up and run the eliza-kappabay-agent:
   ```bash
   cd eliza-kappabay-agent
   # Follow instructions in its README.md
   ```

2. Then set up and run the kappabay-terminal-next:
   ```bash
   cd ../kappabay-terminal-next
   # Follow instructions in its README.md
   ```

Both components must be running simultaneously for the full system functionality.
