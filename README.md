## Setup

To run the complete system:

1. First set up and run the eliza-kappabay-agent:

   ```bash
   cd eliza-kappabay-agent
   # Follow instructions in its README.md
   ```

2. Then set up and run the kappabay-terminal-next:
   ```bash
   cd ../kappabay-terminal-next
   # Follow instructions in its README.md
   ```

Both components must be running simultaneously for the full system functionality.
